# data-structures

This is a project I worked on as a student at Hack Reactor, with [@TheBecky](https://github.com/TheBecky), and alone. The project implements in javascript the following data-structures:

## Data structures:

- Queue
- Stack
- Set
- LinkedList
- Tree
- BinarySearchTree
- Graph
- HashTable

## Inheritance

The queue and stack data structures were done with four different construction patterns:

- Functional
- Functional-Shared
- Prototypal
- Pseudoclassical
